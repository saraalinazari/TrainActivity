# TrainActivity

1. User can see the train schedules. 
    - I have some calculations in a function to calculate arrive time.
2. User can insert new train schedule by using name, destination, frequency, and first train time.
    - If user insert any formats besides HH:MM for first train time, application does not take the data and show error messages to user.
    - If user insert data besides numbers for frequnecy, application shows error message to user to fix it and does not save the data in database.
